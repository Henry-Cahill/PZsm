## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are the Project Zomboid Server Manager development team, and we highly encourage you to refrain from directly messaging us about bugs or security breaches encountered by our app.

We recommend you post the three locations: Indiestone Forum post, Discord Bug page with respectful primary language, and GitHub bug reporting with commenting. 
We will try to post or elaborate on your concerns.
